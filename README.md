# HotbarRandomizer
A Python application built with PyQt6 that allows users to select checkboxes, and with the press of a button, randomly choose a selected checkbox and simulate typing its associated number. This tool simulates keypresses to automate repetitive tasks in games or applications. Specifically, it was created to place random block patterns in Minecraft.
